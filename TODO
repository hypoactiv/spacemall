TODO rethink exported fields/methods on all structs


can transaction support ever return? (seems not)



the journey to pathfinding  (getting there!!)
  - a*-search(src, dst) Path
      if src.room == dst.room:
        mode = 1
      else
        query cache(src,dst) and return if hit
        mode = 0
      if mode == 1, each edge length is 1, nodes are tiles, neighbors and NSEW tiles minus obstructions, hueristic is L1 distance (or something else)
      if mode == 0, neighbors of src are doors of src.root, edge lengths is len(a*-search(src, door)), huersitic is L1 distance, nodes are src, dst, and intermediate doors


Can entities have continuous position?

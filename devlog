opening title screen needs to instantly get the point across. lots of shit running around. the name "SPACE MALL" spelled out with walls, with dudes runing between the letters. dudes chasing mouse cursor/finger. bright colors and smiles. looks like a dos game. induces lulz instantly or die. "HIDE MENU" option for people that just want to play with the crazy shit in the background


purpose:
  to practice proper design
  to write high-performance go code

lessons learned:
  feature implementatin
  start with external usage, go towards internals
    this avoids the nasty case where internals have to be thrown away because
    the use case wasn't right
  list invariants and implement invariant checking first
  use invariant checking to guide implementation and find bugs
  struct field order impacts performance. moving neighbor block pointers above block data gave significant speedup
